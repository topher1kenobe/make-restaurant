== Description ==
A CHILD THEME OF MAKE: This theme includes template files for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/restaurant/">Restaurant</a> plugin by Justin Tadlock.  It does NOT require this plugin, but without it this theme is vanilla Make.  As a child theme, it DOES require the Make theme be installed.  This theme was commissioned by <a href="http://ostraining.com/">OSTraining.com</a> and there are extensive tutorials there.

== Credits ==
This theme was built by topher1kenobe and commissioned by <a href="http://ostraining.com/">OSTraining.com</a>.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Usage ==
This theme is built with the assumption that you will install and use Justin Tadlock's <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/restaurant/">Restaurant</a> plugin.  If you don't intend to do that, please simply use Make.

Once you have Restaurant installed, in the admin area you'll see a primary nav item called Restaurant.  In there you can create food menu items.  Food items can be re-ordered by dragging them around in the admin area item list.

There's also a Tags section where you can group items under things like Breakfast, Lunch, Gluten Free, etc.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the design of this theme? =

Make uses the WordPress Customizer extensively.  When you're logged into your site visit the front of your site (not the admin area) and in the top left, in the admin toolbar, hover over your site name.  A menu will drop down, and you can choose Customize.

= How do I add Food Menu items? =

Once the Restaurant plugin is activated you'll see an admin nav item called Restaurant.  Under that you'll see "Add Menu Item".  Click that and you'll be able to add a new Menu item.

= How do I put different menu items into different menu sections? =

This is done using the tags option of the Restaurant plugin.  Create tags for your Menu sections (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, etc) and assign your Menu items to those tags.
